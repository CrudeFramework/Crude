# [Crude](https://crudehq.github.io/Crude/)
Crude is a small & simple project.

Check out <https://crudehq.github.io/Crude/> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Crude:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/CrudeHQ/Crude/archive/master.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CrudeHQ/Crude.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Crude/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── crude.min.css
│   └── crude.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Crude is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 1400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just pure vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
